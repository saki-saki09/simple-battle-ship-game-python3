#Simple-Battle-Ship-Game-Python3
This an practice project for beginners of python... This could help them in learning...

Here I made a Battle-Ship game... which can be played in the Command Promt.

When you execute the game... you have to guess a row and column in range of 0 to 4 (including 4)... 

#Here-I-Set-a-System-That ...
When someone give a value out of the range it will return a statement that will say "Missed The Ship..."
When someone give a value that is in the range but not the value of target ... will set a 'X' in the part of that Battle-board which is guessed by the user
When someone give a value that is in the range and already have 'X' in it... It'll return that "Already attacked there once..."
When someone give a value that is in the range and also the value of target... It'll set a 'âˆš' in the part of that Battle-baord and ask the user if he want to quit...
Here I have set another thing which is... when someone give a value 'q' or 'quit' this will immediately break the game-loop... and quit the game...

Hope You'll like it... 

#Thank-You ...
